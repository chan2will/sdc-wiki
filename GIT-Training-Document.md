**1. History:**

Git is a widely used version control systems for software development. 
Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in April 2005 (10 years ago).
Git is primarily developed on Linux, although it also supports most major operating systems including BSD, Solaris, OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
**2. Introduction:**

	**Git is a free and open source tool**

		Distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to 		very large projects with speed and efficiency.
	**Git is fast. **

		With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed 		advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with 		a server somewhere.
	**Distributed**

		One of the nicest features of any Distributed SCM, Git included, is that it's 			distributed. This means that instead of doing a "checkout" of the current tip of 		the source code, you do a "clone" of the entire 	repository.

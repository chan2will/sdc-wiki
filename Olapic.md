###  What is Olapic? 
Olapic self defines itself as a "Earned Content Platform [that] amplifies engagement and performance for brands like West Elm, American Eagle Outfitters, & JetBlue using real customer photos." Olapic also seems to be a tool used for marketing teams to aggregate images from social media platforms, and place said images on to an application through the use of an iframe based widget.

The asset transfer service helps upload/process files as automatically and asynchronously as possible. It currently only supports OBJ treatment plan assets (kind PROVPREV in the cases_treatment_plan_asset table). This workflow contains three major components: [The Asset Watcher](https://github.com/CamelotVG/sdc-asset-watcher), The Asset Transfer Service, and the Smilecheck Staff Portal Integration.

## What is a VPN (from Wikipedia)?
VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and it is used to extend a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may, therefore, benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

## How to log into our network
1.) Visit https://vpn.bt.smileco.com and download Cisco AnyConnect
2.) When outside of the home office you may boot the application.
3.) Once booted you will be prompted to connect to a server through a domain name. You will use https://vpn.bt.smileco.com once again.
4.) Verify your AD credentials once again, at this point AnyConnect will open a browser and you can now access our testing environments.

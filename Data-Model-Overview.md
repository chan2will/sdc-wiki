## Data Model Overview

In your local environment, visit `http://localhost:8000/models/` to view a graphic visualization of our Django models.

* This diagram was created by using [`django-spaghetti-and-meatballs`](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs)
* The diagram is not comprehensive, and you can adjust which apps and models are included/excluded by updating `SPAGHETTI_SAUCE` in `settings.local.py`
* Additional customization is possible, [see documentation here for details](http://django-spaghetti-and-meatballs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customising.html).
